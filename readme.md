# **Design**

## **Design Process**

Blogiverse was designed with a user-centric approach, prioritizing ease of navigation, visual appeal, and meaningful interaction. The design process began with identifying the needs of two primary user groups: content creators (writers) and content consumers (readers).

Wireframes were created to map out the user journey, from browsing forums to creating and engaging with posts. The goal was to ensure a seamless experience, whether users were casually exploring or actively contributing. Accessibility was a key focus, with responsive layouts tested across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices to accommodate all users.

## **Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme was carefully chosen to evoke warmth, engagement, and clarity:

* **`#000000` (Black)** - Used for primary text to ensure maximum readability and contrast
* **`#E84610` (Orange-Red)** - Applied to interactive elements like like buttons and alerts, drawing attention to key actions
* **`#4A4A4F` (Dark Gray)** - Used for secondary text to maintain visual hierarchy without being overwhelming
* **`#009FE3` (Cyan)** - Employed for links and navigation elements, adding vibrancy and guiding user actions
* **`#F9FAFC` (Light Gray)** - Used as the primary background to create a clean, modern aesthetic

![Colour Palette](docs/design/colour-palette.png)

*Palette generated using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000)*

CSS `:root` variables were implemented to ensure consistency and easy maintenance:

```css
:root {
    --primary-text: #000000;
    --accent-color: #E84610;
    --secondary-text: #4A4A4F;
    --link-color: #009FE3;
    --background: #F9FAFC;
}
```

## **Typography**

Typography was selected for clarity, readability, and aesthetic harmony:

### **Montserrat**
* **Usage**: Headers, titles, and navigation elements
* **Purpose**: Conveys boldness and modernity while maintaining excellent readability
* **Fallback**: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif

### **Lato**
* **Usage**: Body text, descriptions, and content
* **Purpose**: Clean, approachable style ensuring comfortable reading experiences
* **Fallback**: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif

### **Font Awesome**
* **Usage**: Icons throughout the interface
* **Purpose**: Enhanced visual cues for actions like likes, comments, and navigation
* **Examples**: Heart icons for likes, comment bubbles, user profiles

## **Wireframes**

Wireframes were created for key pages to ensure optimal user experience across all device sizes:

* **Homepage/Forum List** - Overview of all available forums with post previews
* **Post Detail Page** - Individual post view with comments and interaction options
* **Create/Edit Post** - Form layouts for content creation and editing
* **User Authentication** - Login, signup, and password reset pages

*[Wireframes created using Balsamiq/Figma - Add actual wireframe images here]*
