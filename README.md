# **Design & User Experience**

## **Design Philosophy:**
Blogiverse was designed with a user-centric approach, prioritizing ease of navigation, visual appeal, and meaningful interaction. The design process focused on creating an environment that encourages authentic storytelling while maintaining professional aesthetics that don't overshadow the content itself.

## **Colour Scheme:**
The colour palette was carefully selected to evoke warmth, trust, and engagement while ensuring accessibility:

* **`#000000` (Black)** - Primary text color ensuring maximum readability and contrast
* **`#E84610` (Orange-Red)** - Interactive elements like like buttons and alerts, creating visual emphasis
* **`#4A4A4F` (Dark Gray)** - Secondary text maintaining visual hierarchy without overwhelming users  
* **`#009FE3` (Cyan)** - Links and navigation elements, adding vibrancy and guiding user actions
* **`#F9FAFC` (Light Gray)** - Primary background creating a clean, modern aesthetic

CSS custom properties ensure consistent color application:

```css
:root {
    --primary-text: #000000;
    --accent-color: #E84610;
    --secondary-text: #4A4A4F;
    --link-color: #009FE3;
    --background: #F9FAFC;
}
```

## **Typography:**
Typography choices prioritize readability and aesthetic harmony:

### **Montserrat**
* **Usage**: Headers, titles, and navigation elements
* **Purpose**: Conveys boldness and modernity while maintaining excellent readability
* **Fallback**: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif

### **Lato**  
* **Usage**: Body text, descriptions, and content
* **Purpose**: Clean, approachable style ensuring comfortable reading experiences
* **Fallback**: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif

### **Font Awesome**
* **Usage**: Icons throughout the interface
* **Purpose**: Enhanced visual cues for actions like likes, comments, and navigation

## **Wireframes:**
Comprehensive wireframes were developed for all key user interactions:
